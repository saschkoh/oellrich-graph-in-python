# oellrich-graph-in-python
This is a Python implementation of a generic graph class, derived from the C++ implementation of Prof. Martin Oellrich. The goal is to create a tool for additional implementations of algorithms on graphs, such as the Dijkstra-algorithm. It was implemented as part of a university assignment for the course "Operations Research" at the Berlin University of Applied Sciences ([BHT](https://www.bht-berlin.de/)) of [Department II](https://www.bht-berlin.de/ii).

## Usage
In order to use the graph class, you can either:
* download the repository and import the graph class into your project
* download the latest release from the [releases]() page and import the graph class into your project
* fork the repository and use it as a submodule in your project
